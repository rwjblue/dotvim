# rwjblue/dotvim

This is my personal NeoVim setup. It has and will continue to grow over time.
It is based on the [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) distribution.
It uses [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as a package manager.

## Setup

```sh
git clone git://github.com/rwjblue/dotvim.git ~/.config/nvim
nvim --headless "+Lazy! restore" +qa
```
